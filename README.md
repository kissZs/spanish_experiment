This is the repository for my paper. 'Developing Comprehension Using TL Media'(Unpublished)

The Journal folder contains the journal files named journal_week[number].txt that were uploaded weekly. They are delimited by lines containing only a ; and empty entries are denoted by a ! See Complete Journal.pdf for a more readable version.

The Time Data folder contains Excel files that contain when I started and ended all my sessions, they are as I exported them from Clockify except that I removed some unnecessary columns. I don't think you can open these straight from github, you have to download them.

See the Comprehension scores.xlsx for a more detailed, written version of Figure 2.
