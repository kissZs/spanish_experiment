# spanish_experiment

This is the repository for my project described in the write-up 'What 1000 Hours of L2 Media Exposure Did to a Complete Beginner': https://github.com/kissZs/spanish_experiment/blob/main/1000%20Hours%20of%20L2%20Media%20v2.pdf

The Journal folder contains the journal files named journal_week[number].txt that were uploaded weekly. They are delimited by lines containing only a ; and empty entries are denoted by a ! See Complete Journal.pdf for a more readable version.

The Time Data folder contains Excel files that contain when I started and ended all my sessions, they are as I exported them from Clockify except that I removed some unnecessary columns. I don't think you can open these straight from github, you have to download them.

See Comprehension scores.xlsx for a more detailed, written version of Figure 2.

(The original write-up contained some bold claims about SLA that I still stand by, however I now admit that it had little to do with the experiment, and I have a stronger but argument for them than the one in the parer that has absolutelly nothing to do with the experiment, therefore these were cut from the new version.)
