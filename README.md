# spanish_experiment

This is the repository for my experiment in which I will attempt to learn Spanish, solely by consuming media in the language, without using dictionaries, learning grammar or any form of instruction.

This will be my second attempt. During my first attempt I have watched 30.5 hours of TV shows in Spanish, between the 11th and the 15th of February 2021. Daily logs, taken in video format can be found in the repository.

The other files in the repositry are a documentation of my second attempt.


Information about the experimntal subject(me):
* Native language: Hungarian
* Second Languages: English, Japanese, (In addition I had German classes for 4 years, but I have gained practically zero competence, although I remember a bit about the grammar and a handful of words)
* Age at the start of the second attempt:21
* Location during both attempts: Hungary


About the second attempt:

* Start: 2021-06-28
* Time goal: 1000 hours (Including the 30.5 from the first attempt)

I will count the hours I spend with Spanish organized into the following categories: 
* Audio-only 
* Audiovisual 
* Subtitled (Spanish subtitled audiovisual) 
* Text-only 
* Text with visuals (for example comic books and movies in an unrelated language with Spanish subtitles)
* Speaking
* Unspecified

I will occaisonally make journal entries, and I will rate at least one piece of content every week, on the following scale:
* 0	I don't understand anything
* 5	I recognize a word here and there, but I can't understand any sentence other than maybe the rare 2-3 words long one every-now and then
* 10	I  regularly recognize words and, rearly, I can even understand simple sentences that are a few words long
* 15	I am familiar with most words that I encounter, but I can only understand short and simple sentences regurarly, and I only ocasionally understand more complex sentences
* 20	I understand a good chunk of the sentences I encounter, but I also don't understand a good chunck of them. Understanding a sentence is 'not the norm' Most of my ability to follow the text still comes from other means (e.g. guess from the visuals)
* 25	I understand the majority of sentences I see, but it feels like I still don't understand the imprtant ones, I can follow the text to some extent, but I loose track very often and regularly
* 30	I understand most sentences, and understanding them is 'the norm', and I can follow a good chunk of what is being talked about but I still loose track often, and sentences I don't understand still show up often.
* 35	I can follow most of what is being talked about, but I loose track occasionally, and sentences I don't understand show up regurarly, but most of the time aren't too much of a problem because of context. A lot of the nuance is lot on me.(jokes, cultural and implicit stuff)
* 40	I can follow pretty much all of what is talked about and understand almost all sentences with occasional exceptions, but some of the nuance is still lost on me. I still encounter a lot of words I don't know
* 45	I understand virtually all senteces and never loose track, but occasional unknown words still show up, and a bit of of the nuance is still lost, not quite puting me at the level of a native speaker
* 50	My understanding is on the level of a native speaker

I plan on posting weekly updates on reddit.
