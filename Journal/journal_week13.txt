After watching the Matrix I decided it's time to switch to speakers, and based on the children's show Witch the difference is not nearly as drastic as it was
a few weeks ago. Also, kind of off topic but 7 year old me would kill me if he knew that I openly admited to watching these girly shows like Witch and H2O
that I had liked in secret.

The word for 'Hungarian' came up today in quien mató a Sara but I can't recall it, I think it might have been húngara? I'm surprised that it came up in my immersion,
but I guess 500 hours is a long time.

I'm seeing some progress with Mexican shows when i watch them with subtitles, my main difficulty with them is now just my hearing. Based on the peek I took at  the show
Élite, this does not extend to Spanish shows, I think the slang might be somewhat different. For example I don't seem to be hearing 'güey' in Élite and I don't recall
people calling others who aren't their uncles 'tío' in Mexican shows. I think I'm gonna stick to Mexican shows until I make the transition to speakers without subs,
and then try to branch out to shows with different accents.

I just noticed that last week I forgot to write in the 'What I did' column of my Comprehension scores spreadsheet, and since I started giving comprehension scores more frequently
I don't even think it has a point anymore, so I'm gonna stop writing in it.
