This week I dropped Dragon ball and started experimenting a bit and it looks pretty bad. Dubbed things were ok, not exactly good, I couldn't follow a movie I picked at random but
I can follow a show, Anne with an e, that I picked at random from Netflix. I hope that my perception is skewed by Japanese because Anime appears to be a lot easier to understand
than live-action shows, I tried the first episodes of two anime and I understood them at an OK level so I hope that means I'm good.

I'm surprised by how well I understand science videos on Youtube, fiction is way way harder (probably because of the cognates) I thought it would be the other way around.

The really bad news is that my comprehension of Spanish TV shows is atrocious. The difficulty mainly comes from not being able to make out what they are saying, because
when I turn on the subtitles, it's a lot better, it's still not as good as I expected based on my reading: I think I can read pretty much any manga, but it's still ok I think.
I don't know why this is, it's not because it's translated vs non-translated, that would mean that Youtube would also be hard, there is just something about the
audio or the mumbling or I don't know. I experience a similar difference in Japanese and English but not nearly to this extent.

Last week I was almost certain that I would get acceptable results because of how well I understand science videos and manga, but now I'm less sure than I was on week 2.
I feel really demotivated and I didn't really feel like writing in my journal and I think I'm gonna cut back on my immersion hours this week.

I discovered that my problems with my listening are a bit better when using headphones, so I will switch back to using them.
I also noticed the some of the names of the fingers today. I can't recall them but the word for the index finger is a cognate and the one for the middle finger contains 'coraz√≥n'
