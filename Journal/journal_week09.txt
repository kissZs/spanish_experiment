Phonology update: I think I can hear the difference between r and rr, other than that I'm pretty sure about afew things like: y and ll are the same sound, and they
only refer to one sound, the two different sounds I noted earlier seem to be allophones of this one phoneme, and that Ã¼ and u are the same sound. Of course I can't really
say these for certain, because there is always the possibility that I just can't hear the difference, but I have some conscious evidence for the former: the dude I mentioned
who replaces his y-s with a sh sound does the exact same thing with ll, and I hear certain words like 'yo' pronounced with both sounds that I think are allophones.

The one thing that I'm very unsure about is the sound they write with an h: I have no idea if it exists or not. If it does exist it is definitely different from a j
and it must be a much softer version of it. I do hear it sometimes but I also thought for a long time that I can hear the difference between English 'night' and 'knight' which I obviously can't.
It's crazy how much spelling can effect what you think you hear, and all the conscious evidence I have points towards the fact that the h-sound doesn't exist and that it's just a silent letter.
The evidence is the following: the word for 'and' is 'y' and is pronounced as 'i' but when it comes before an i it's an 'e' e.g. 'e importante'. But it also changes
before a hi like in 'e hiciste'. Second, I seem to hear the phenomenon I described earlier where phonemes aren't repeated at the borders of words also happens if there
is a h between two vowels as in 'voy a hacerlo' which would be pronounced as 'voyacerlo' I think.

Today I switched from using headphones to using speakers for listening, and for the Youtube videos I watch it makes little difference, but Dragon Ball
is way harder to understand and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because of the poor sound quality. Also, doing long listening sessions this way is a lot easier
for me. This, combined with my light week before has completely cured my burnout for now, I feel great.

I came across a meme that comes pretty close to explaining some grammar, so I thought I should mention it:
https://www.planetaneperiano.com/neperianada/64174/latest/all/LO-HERMOSO-DE-LA-DIVERSIDAD-VERBAL
I was mostly aware of all of these and have a rough idea of what they mean except for the ones in the bottom right and some in the bottom left 
that I recognise by the ie part in them. I thought these was only one with that ie part but it turns out there are actually 3 (times 6 for the different subject of course)

Also, today I was reading a manga called Gantz and at around chapter 200 the already bad translation got so bad that they literally just leave half of it in Japanese
and just write the translation in the white space between the panels, but sometimes they don't even bother to do that. Luckily my Japanese reading is not as effortless
as my latin alphabet reading so I can avoid reading them.
