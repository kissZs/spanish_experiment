Yesterday I started watching Modern Family in English yesterday and I have to say these past 3 years that I spent on Japanese and Spanish did not have a good effect
on my English listening, my reading is completely fine, same with Youtube videos and animation like Rick and Morty, but with live action it's horrible, especially
with speakers. This makes me think that my speakers problem with Spanish will last a lot longer than expected, so the new plan is to watch dubbed stuff and youtube
on speakers and original Spanish shows with headphones, getting familiar with more accents before making the transition to speakers, instead of after.

Also, there are some Spanish lines in Modern Family, but I think it should be negligible so I'm not gonna count it nor avoid the show for this reason. I don't know
if I've said this before but same goes for when a Spanish song comes on the radio or something, though it has only happened once so far if I recall correctly.

I quit using subtitles for Mexican shows, a rewatched a part of Oscuro deseo and I'm gonna rewatch the first season of Quien mat√≥ a Sara and then the second season which
I have not seen yet. I will also start to watch European Spanish shows with subs more often.
