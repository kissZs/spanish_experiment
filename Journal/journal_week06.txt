So I guess it's time for an update on verb conjugation. I didn't find out much consciously, I realised that there is a separate form for 2PL that's distinct from 3PL
contrary to what I thought, same with the perfect and continuous forms, the former tends to end with -do and the latter with -ndo, and I noticed the existence of
what I call the hyopthetical form, because I don't know a general linguistic term for it, some examples include 'podria' and 'gustaria'. I have no idea about the actual
rules for conjugations, but I think I can conjugate certain verbs in the present tense. For example 'soy eres es somos sois son', 'se sabes sabe sabemos sabeis(??) saben',
'hablo hablas habla hablamos hablais(??) hablan' I think I can also recognise the past and future tense for the most part, but they are still fuzzy.

It looks like the Amazon package tracker thing cickstarted my acquisition of the names of the days of the week, I still can't recall most of them, but I can recognise
them in context most of the time: the one that's similar to luna is Monday, the one that starts with a v is Friday, sabado(?) is Saturday and domingo is Sunday, two of the
others start with an m and one with a j I think, but I have no idea which of those is which.

I'm also starting to get the hang of the numbers, 0-10: cero uno dos tres cuatro cinco seis siete ocho nueve deiz, 11-05 are irregular: once doce trerce(?) catorce quince
and for other two digit number you make with 'name for the tens' + y + 'name for the ones'. 20 is veinte and 30 is trenta and I don't know the rest. For higher numbers
I think you just say the digit plus 100 1000 1 000 000 etc. which are ciento (sometimes just cien ?) mil and million respectively.

I am reading surprisingly slowly, it took me like 6 hours to read the first 100 pages of Harry Potter. On the bright side, I noticed that there are two distinct past tenses
as in 'estaba' vs 'estuvo' I'm not exactly sure what the difference is, but the latter feels 'closer' if that makes sense, so I'm gonna call it the recent past tense,
for example if someone says a good joke and you want to say 'that was good', 'estuvo bien' sounds better than 'estaba bien'. And with that I think I got all of the inflected
forms of verbs: present, past, recent past, future (e.g. iré), imperative (e.g. escuchen), hypothetical(e.g. podría), infinitive (e.g. caer), perfective (e.g. hecho) and
continuous (e.g. haciendo), plus different forms of these conjugated for the subject where applicable.

I used to think that there were also different inflections for different objects, but it's so much of an inflection as it is just appending me/te/lo/la/le/se/nos/os and
their plurals to the end or beginning of the verb. They are in a pretty straight forward correspondence with pronouns, except for 'le' which is used in place of lo/la
for indirect objects and 'se' which means something like 'one's self' in phrases like 'hide yourself'.

With that being said, I mentioned that this 'se' bothered me before along with 'ya' which is used similarly to 'already'. I didn't learn these today, it's just that
it's hard to pinpoint when exactly I learn something, so that by the time I'm sure I know it, it feels like I've known them forever.
