I have started re-watching Oscuro deseo and plan to rewatch Quién mató a Sara. I will have seen them 2 times fully and half of them 3 times. I will also make this
my last attempt at fixing my heaphone to speakers problem, and in general i think that this 'picking the low hanging fruit' by forcing myself to immerse in new topics
is over, I think I'll just do whatever I want for the rest of the experiment, which right now means reading Harry Potter.
