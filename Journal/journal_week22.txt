I decided to start practicing speaking today. Since the experiments main focus is on comprehension, I want to rule out the possibility that the correction that
and explanations that I could receive while speaking with others could effect the development of my comprehension. 

For this reason I decided to only speak to myself before the end of the experiment. The problem is that I'm not very good at talking to myself, so what I will do
is, as some people online recommend, I will summarize things that I watch/read during my immersion.

My choice for the first recording is retelling the tale of the three brothers from the final Harry Potter book that I read recently. I will reread
that part and then proceed to make the recording.

Ok I made it. I didn't listen to the full thing, but I couldn1t avoid listening to some of it to ensure that there were no technical problems. It was not exactly good
but it wasn't terrible either. From the bit of it that I did hear I can tell that I made lots of grammar mistakes that I would have said differently if I weren't speaking
in real time.

I don't think that it's at a level where with just a little bit of speaking I could improve it massively, so I won't speak more during the experiment.
