Today I was watching One piece as usual with it's subtitles that don't always match exactly but are ok 9 times out of 10. 
Or so they were until now. On episode 67-ish the subtitles suddenly changed and it's now unusable for me, so I guess I won't be using subtitles 
for the foreseeable future. The good news is that while searching for a better site for reading manga, I opened one of them from the most popular list to
see how the site worked, and to my surprise I could actually follow it for the most part. It's called Ijiranaide Nagatoro-san and it's some pathetic fetish thing
that's remarkably easy to follow, perhaps even more so than Yotsuba, and I'm actually enjoying it for some reason, I think I'll read it.

My listening is still not as good as my reading but I think that the gap is at a more normal level, so I won't worry about it too much, but still, 
with the loss of One Piece I started putting more care into what I listen to and I found this show aimed at very young children that's called Ben and Holly.
It's not exactly entertaining, but I can actually follow along somewhat so it's still better than watching something where I don't understand the story.

My motivation changes from day to day like I'm on a roller coaster. One day I feel like I'm doing great, understanding a lot of things, but on others it feels like 
the content I'm consuming gets more complicated at a certain point, except that when I look back at the parts I read the day before they also feel the same.
It also doesn't help that I have no idea if I'm doing well or not.

It feels so good when I finally notice what sets two similar words apart. For the most part I don't remember the words exactly, only as jumble of letters or sounds,
and I usually dont know what sets apart words that sound similar or refer to similar things for example I just figured out that viaje means something like journey and vieja
refers to an old woman. Another set that has been bothering me for a while are the c-nouns for head related things. I think I got it more or less down: cara is face cabezo is head,
cabello means hair. I'm not sure about the last one because there is a very similar c??b??ll?? word that probably means horse. This is even worse with verbs that are a lot more
fuzzy because of the conjugation. But I suppose not knowing the words exactly but being able to recognise them in context is a lot better than being able to write them down in a vocab quiz
but not being able to recognize them.

It's also worth noting that I guess the meanings of new words a lot less often than before. Also I think I've reached the limit of what I can figure out about the grammar and phonetics consciously,
so I've stopped making guesses about those all together. Here is what I figured out so far: The writing is pretty much completely phonetic, the few sounds that I have problems with are
ll and y which may or may not be the same sound, and I think I tend to hear two sounds for y one voiced and the other not, this might just be allophonic. One of the few things that I knew about 
Spanish before this experiment is that it distinguishes between rolled and unrolled r-s which would explain the difference between r and rr, but I speak languages with rolled and unrolled r-s so I think I would be
able to hear the difference between the two but I can't which leads me to doubt my memory. I'm also not sure if the h is silent or not most of the time or if it's just a very soft version of j. 
The vowels are a lot simpler, I'm pretty sure that there are only 5: a i u e and o, but I've seen an ü written down but it only seem to appear in vergüenza and I think it's pronounced as an u there.
Furthermore I'm sure that there are no long vowels and double consonants, even when two instances of the same sound appear at the boundaries of the words they seem to be realized as just one of that sound.
I also know that the ' thingy marks the accent, but unaccented words have this very particular Spanish-y sound that I have no idea what it is, but I'm certain I could replicate it.

About the grammar, I know that nouns have at least two classes el and la, if there are others they must be very rare. It seems to be mostly random which word belongs to which class, but words that end with an o tend to be el
and words that end with a or ion tend to be la. The plurals end in an s. Adjectives can come either before or after the noun they modify and conjugate to match it's gender and plurality. The verbs work very similar to English with the 
added conjugations for the subject and the object. The latter can also be expressed by putting the me/te... before the verb. There are contionuos and perfect tenses and passive voice, probably expressed by ending the verb in do
and putting a conjugated form of estás, he and soy respectively. I absolutely could not make a table for the actual inflections but I think I can more or less recognize them.
It even has helper verbs like tengo and debes which work kind of like have and must/should. 
Relative clauses are right-branching and seem to start with que.
