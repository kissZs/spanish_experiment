I just realised I made a mistake yesterday. I was watching videos on Youtube and because it's Youtube I automatically started the Audivisual timer 
without thinking about it, but some of the videos that day where just a guy talking into a microphone as if it were a podcast, which I should have
counted as Audio only time, so I changed a 42 minute Audiovisual session to Audio only to compensate. This is just a very rough estimate though.
From now on I'll keep this in mind and edit the data accurately based on the videos length, should such a video pop up during a mainly Audiovisual session.

I started watching Colombian shows and the biggest thing about the accent is that it sometimes seems to not pronounce the 's' sound at the end of syllables. Also there
are some differences in the usage of 2S pronouns: 'usted' is used in much less formal situations, but I can't say that it completely merged with 't√∫' because I did hear that used too,
as well as 'vos', which I don't think anyone would use in real life in Mexican/European Spanish, but is used in Colombia maybe?
