It turns out that that accent that pronounces 'y' and 'll' as a 'sh' is Argentinian. It also seems to use 'vos' instead of 'tú' with some weird conjugations like 'sos'
and the 's' sounds are sometimes silent though not as often as in Colombian Spanish. I remember saying that this accent was easier to understand than European Spanish,
but that has changed, European Spanish seems way easier now, which is not surprising considering that I had more exposure to it.

Today morning I finished the 5th Harry Potter book and I don't think I'll read more of the series during the experiment, so I spent the rest of the day trying
different books, dubbed stuff, Youtube videos, memes and some textbooks, not to give comprehension scores, just to decide my next course of action. 

After taking a quick look at 100 años de soledad and The Count of Monte Cristo again, I can say that I'm already satisfied with my reading, so I don't do more of it regularly,
except for subtitles and for some math/physics textbooks to get more familiar with some technical language. The latter I will count as Text with visuals because
there are diagrams every now and then and because equations can kind of be considered visuals that aren't language I guess. 

So the main thing that I need to work on is my listening: Spanish shows with speakers are still very hard and I'm not sure if I've mentioned this but the same goes for
some Youtube videos like this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itwh5d8IhKU&list=PL9PItSqgQmU2oUWPDUl-Diajb957bcldV Which is really weird because I understand the
host just fine, but not the other players (even though when I check out their channels, there I understand them a lot better.) Same goes some clips of people being interviewed
in science videos.

Anyways, what I'll try doing is first watch a lot of Spanish shows subbed but with speakers, and then later remove the subs.
