Monday

Today was the first day of my second attempt, I retained more words than I thought I would, but I think my ability to tell where one word ends and the other begins has gotten worse.
The only thing I've read today is a comicbook called One Piece, which I've already seen in Japanese. Reading is far easier than listening, 
I think I leant more in today's 7 hours than in the 30 hours of my previous attempt. 
After experimenting with different things, by the end of the day I had found the adaptation of this comicbook in Spanish, with subtitles that match most of the time. 
I think these will be my main source of input. I may be digging myself into a corner by relying too much on reading, but I hope my listening will catch up after I get better.
As for how conscious I am of my acquisiton, I'm unsure, I'm making guesses all the time, cocerning both words and grammar structures.
For example a verb conjugating to end in 'a' is probably some form of imperative (mira, espera etc.)
However I think I've also acquired the skill to tell nouns and verbs apart to some degree, I have no conscious conjectures about this, some words just sound verb-like and others more noun-like.

Reading is suprisingly enjoyable even though I'm not understanding most of it. Yesterday there was an interesting effect that may have occured because of my experience with Japanese.
You see, when I was learning Japanese, sometimes when I encountered a word that I didn't know, but I could guess it's reading I still got that 'Hooray new word understood' feeling, 
despite not actually understanding it. I think this might have tricked my brain, because I was getting this feeling all the time becuse of the phonetic spellings. It wore off this morning.
It was still enjoyable though. Listening however is extremely demoralizing it's mostly gibberish, I can't detect the words that I'm half-familiar with from reading,
but there is no way they aren't there. Reading gives me hope that I could actually learn reasonably fast, but listening seems impossible.

I got tired a lot quicker than I thought I would, listening takes almost no effort, but reading is suprisingly taxing, I can't read for longer than 4 hours a day.
I'm not sure if this is simply because reading is harder than listening even for one's NL or if it's because my brain is working harder trying to decipher the language.
Also, I may not be getting enough sleep, I'll try and see if getting up at 7:30 instead of 6:30 and taking fewer brakes to compensate for it, makes the situation better or worse.
I also take back what I said about the imperative, it apears to be much more complex. Verbs seem to have tenses similar to English 
and they definetly conjugate depending on the subject and object like they do in Hungarian.

Thursday
;
I was very optimistic for the first 3 days, I was learning much faster than expected, I thought there would be more of a snowball effect, 
where I would not understand anything for a long time, but that then it would speed up, however pogress feels suprisingly linear, which actually makes me quite worried.
If the rate at which I'm leaning doesn't speed up then I'm not sure that it will be fast enough to reach an OK level.

Friday
;
There are a number of words that I recognise now, but have no idea what they mean. The two that irritate me the most right now are abaco(not sure if I wrote that correctly)
and cosa, I think I figured out earlier today that the latter may mean thing but I'm not sure. I feel like this is the situation where a dictionary would prove most useful.
I have also found a comicbook that's easier than One Piece, called Yotsuba to. It's incredible how easy it is. I think I'll put off reading One Piece.

It appears that what I thought of as abaco was actually two different verbs abac??? and acab???. My current guess is that the former means finish and the later means die.
Which is weird because I can't tell if there is a difference between that and morir. Anyways, I have made and revised many guesses for a lot words, so it's still possible that
these guesses still aren't correct.

Sunday

I just heard someone use the word 'nada' in an English video about finding pack.png in Minecraft. Luckily I had already known what it meant, so it didn't teach me anything,
but it did lower my motivation a little bit, what if everything I've learned so far is so basic that every American knows it because they live next to Mexico and it's just common knowledge,
like the way it is here in Hungary with a few words of German, and apperantly as 'nada' is. Sure I'm learning, but I have no idea if it's fast enough. 
Though this is not a problem unique to this method, I've always taken what I already know for granted, but it still feels bad. On the bright site, today I clicked on a random manga that the site
I use to read Yotsuba recommended to me because I thought it would be ridiculous based on the title: ¿Qué se debe hacer durante la pandemia de coronavirus? It was like twelve pages long,
but it felt so good to just open something random and understand most of what it was saying.
