It's no wonder English speakers can learn Spanish so fast, beyond the obvious cognates there are a lot of expressions that translate word for word like 
'... rests on your shoulders'

I wonder if there exists a natural order for vocabulary similar to the natural order for certain grammatical features. It would not be as strict, because
I think you can acquire almost any word if it's presented to you frequently enough in comprehensible contexts, even if the word is very rare on the average. However,
I think that the ability to retain them for an extended period of time may be limited by such an ordering principle that is more complicated than simple frequency.
For example, I just learned the word 'manga' which I believe means 'sleeve', but this word is probably not as frequent as most of the others I know, and I'm pretty sure
that I will forget it soon. But if frequency was all that there is to it, then I think that a lot more infrequent words should be present in begginiers vocabularies, because,
while they are much less likely to be acquired, there is also a lot more of them.

I just ordered the Harry Potter series from Amazon Spain and I learnt the word for Hungary in the process, about which I had doubts if it'd ever appear in my immersion but
I saw it when making my order so it's fine.
