I'm gonna do something different with my comprehension ratings this week. So far they have been pretty representative of what content I consumed that week, but
now I'm gonna rate some things that I presume are more difficult and plan to red/watch/listen to in the future. (I may or may not actually get to them) 
I will only spend 30 minutes on each of them and I will rate them on any day of the week, not just on Saturdays and Sundays like before. Starting next week the scores
will return to be representative of what I consume, but I will continue to rate any day of the week, so as ti increase the range of content I score. 

Also today was the first time that I forgot to stop the counter at the end of a session, it reached 02:53:24 of audiovisual time by the time I noticed. Luckily I just started a
new episode on Netflix that session so I know that it was 16 minutes, so I corrected it.

I have to say that my expectations about what would be hard and what wouldn't were completely off. Firstly, I tried other dubbed shows and the difference between
things like Anne with an E, which is pretty every day stuff, and things like Bohemian rhapsody, The theory of everything, Dr. House and House of cards, is a lot
smaller than what I expected the latter two being a bit below what I'd be willing to watch at this point, but I'm entirely comfortable watching the two before that.
But House of cards was my 'last boss' of dubbed content in Japanese, it was the hardest one I found but with Spanish it's not that big of a deal.

I guess when you think about it, there is really no reason for conceptually hard things to be linguistically harder in L2, which I, and many others, assumed, but it's
very far from the truth. This is illustrated even more by how well I understand science videos on youtube.

With this I have gained  lot more confidence about watching dubbed things. I think that one random movie I mentioned last week that I couldn't follow might have been a too early call,
I dropped it after the first few sentences, also it might have been because of the headphones/speakers difference. Making two big jumps, one with the diversity of the content and the 
other with sound quality might not have been the best idea.

Because of this I feel a lot better motivation-wise, I'm pretty sure I can reach an acceptable level with youtube videos, dubbed content and novels, but I'm have no earthly idea if I can
'patch up' my unacceptable shortcomings with native TV shows,  with the gap in understanding when using headphones vs when using speakers, and, of course, 
with speaking when I get to it. (I assume that I will have problems with it)

The really bad news is that, with native Tv shows, not even the subtitles help me as much as I think they should based on how much I understand of novels, which suggests that recognising the sounds is
the only problem, but also the actual vocabulary is different. What I don't undestand about this, is that how can they be so different from something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htg_e_Q8D6s
which also isn't translated from another language. Anyways, with headphones native shows are not as hard as my initial impression of them was but they are still a huge problem.

On the bright side, I tried podcasts for the first time: one about anime, which I understood surprisingly well and a much more every day one which I understood terribly. The good thing about this,
is that with Japanese, when I first started watching podcasts there was this phenomenon where I felt like I understood most of what they were saying in the moment, the 
thing that they were talking about went right over my head. I do not get this with Spanish, I understood one podcast but not the other, and that's it. I have no idea why
this is the case.
