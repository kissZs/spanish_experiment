It seems that with words like chico(boys) and chica(girls) the one ending in o is used for groups of mixed gender. I usually dislike it when languages have male and
female variants of words like actor/actress but Spanish does something with them that I find interesting: novio means boyfriend and novia means girlfriend
but because novio is used for mixed groups, novios can be used to mean something like lovers, not just boyfriends. Today I noticed that padre and madre (father and mother)
can be used in a similar way, so that padres can mean parents. I'm not sure if there is an actual word for parents or not.

When I was learning Japanese I remember thinking how weird it was that they substituted v in foreign words with a b sound, because to me they sounded nothing alike, now
however I'm actually misshearing one for the other quite often, especially in words like debes. I'm also beginning to think that there are no different pronouns for 
second person plural and third person plural, they are both just ustedes, though I'm not sure about this.
