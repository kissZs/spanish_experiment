So engaging with more European Spanish made me realize that my Harry Potter books are written in European Spanish, which I mean duh I ordered them from Spain, but it's
just that I didn't expect there to be any significant difference in writing so I never really thought about it. But now it resolved something that has been bugging me
for a long time which is the difference between 'ustedes' vs 'vosotros': I used to think that 'vosotros' turned into 'ustedes' at a lower level of politeness than 
'él/ella' turned into 'ustedes' and that I just had to get a feel for where this barrier was, but it looks like it's the same as in the singular case in European Spanish
and 'ustedes' seems to have more or less absorbed 'vosotros' in Mexican Spanish.

I have also started noticing one of the last verb forms from that meme I saw. If we call 'estaría' 'estuviera' and 'estuviese' hypothetical 1, hypothetical 2a and
hypothetical 2b respectively, then I think I can conjugate hypothetical 1 and 2a and have a rough idea of what they mean, and I started noticing hypothetical 2b which
seems to be some form of past tense of hypothetical 2a maybe? I have no idea about the last missing form, which I'm gonna call hypotetical 2c. I don't recall ever
noticing it.

My reading speed has improved a lot since the first Harry Potter book, I think it took me around 3:40 minutes to read a page and now it takes around 2:15. The average
reading speed in English seems to be around 200 words per minute, the Harry Potter series has 1,084,170 words meaning it should take around 72 hours to read. Assuming that
that's roughly the same for the Spanish translation, my copy of which is 3800 pages long according to Amazon, it should take around 1:25 minutes to read a page, so it's
still not ideal. Anyways this means that it should take me almost a 100 hours to finish the series, which I'd like to do before the deadline, as well as read at least
some of The Count of Monte Cristo and some textbooks, so I can't really focus as much on listening as I planned a while ago. I'm actually somewhat happy about this, 
because I'm starting to enjoy the books, I have only seen the movies and read the first 2 books in Japanese, so it's somewhat new to me.

OK so this week I finished Witch and watched the rest of The theory of everything which I watched the first half of with headphones a while ago, and while it's still
way harder with speakers, I think I'm gonna consider the transition from headphones to speakers complete for dubbed content and youtube videos.
