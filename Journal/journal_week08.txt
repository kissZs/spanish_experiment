Today I gave a score to Dragon Ball that's lower than the week before. I expected this to happen sooner or later because it is self-assessment after all, but it still
feels bad. Speaking of my scoring system, so far I'm pretty satisfied with it, I like how I made no mention of how well one should be able to follow the piece of content
on a whole at the lower levels, because this varied to great extent, depending on how much the visuals helped. 

But I'm not happy about a few lines I included like:
'understanding them[sentences] is 'the norm''. Although I do understand and expect to understand most of the sentences if I rate something above this score, it all
still feels like a miracle that I can understand them. This may just be because of how intense my learning has been, I knew basically no Spanish two months ago.

Also 'I understand the majority of sentences I see, but it feels like I still don't understand the imprtant ones'. I didn't get this feeling at all, when learning Japanese
this might have been the case, because I feel like cognates in Spanish seem to be more frequent in exposition dumps, the absence of which in Japanese lead me to not understand
'the important bits'. That, or I might just remember wrong and this didn't happen with Japanese either.

And finally I don't like my mentions of nuance, it doesn't seem to correlate in the way I thought with the other parts of my descriptions.

Going on a tangent about 'I knew basically no Spanish two months ago', I have to mention that this all feels very weird, I know it a sounds dumb but it feels
like the language is just made up, like it only exists in the bubble that is my room I use to immerse. This may be because Spanish was not a part of my life
before I started learning it, sure I heard a few songs and they spoke it in Breaking Bad, but for English I had video games, for Japanese anime and for German I live
next to the Austrian border, and the presence that Spanish had is basically nothing compared to that. The fact that I don't care that much about actually learning Spanish
might also play a part.
