I originally planned to read a bit about quantum physics, which I thought I could do, because I had started reading a book called 'Quantum Theory for Mathematicians'
in English (I didn't get very far) so I tried to find something similar in Spanish but I couldn't find anything. The books that I did find begin with the black body
problem which seems to actually require knowing some physics, which I don't. (I had studied physics in high school but all I remember is mechanics)

Because of this, I tried various physics textbooks throughout the week, including the part about special relativity of the Feynman Lectures, 
which lead me to checking out Einstein's original paper, and I had the idea to try to explain his derivation of the Lorentz transformation at the end of the experiment
as a test of my speaking skills. 

I'll do it with some minimal preparation: I will read that part a lot of times, I will go through the
equations myself trying to not think in Spanish while doing it, and I will make a not for myself with some keywords and key equations, but I won't plan or write down
what I'll say exactly.

I think this is a great topic because it's technical but still kind of accessible. You only need to know a bit of calculus, which is only used at one and step, and v= s/t to understand it.

Another thing that I plan to do to test my speaking at the end is to join a Minecraft survival server with an active Discord voice chat which is proving to be difficult to find
so I may have to think of something else.

Good news: I have managed to simplify Einstein's derivation so that it now requires no calculus, and I think I found my Minecraft server, though it's voice chat doesn't seem to be too
active. For that case I have joined a few very large Discord servers for gaming and anime but I'd rather go with the small one.
