Before starting the experiment, I was completely sure that English not being my native language would not be a hinderance. If I didn't know English, then Spanish would probably
a 2000 hour language for me, not a 1000 hour one, because Hungarian is a 2000 hour language for native English speakers, so I assume English is a 2000 hour language for native Hungarian
speakers, so that Spanish is probably the same. I thought that my English was good enough that there wouldn't be a noticeable difference between me and a native English speaker in this
regard, and I still think this but I'm now less sure. I started encountering cognates in English that I didn't know before but could have been of huge help for Spanish,
like, most recently, 'unequivocally' and 'nascent' for 'equivocar' and 'nacer'.

I have started watching dubbed movies on a lower volume, instead of jumping straight to using speakers, for this reason I have returned to childrens shows and to movies
that I watched over and over as a kid, I'm hoping to gradually adjust to watching dubbed things with speakers. I hope it won't take long. In the meanwhile I will continue to
watch original Spanish shows with subtitles to help build my vocabulary, and after that I'll go through the same procedure with them: headphones -> headphones on a low volume -> 
speakers. Non-subtitle reading is gonna take a backseat for the rest of the experiment.
