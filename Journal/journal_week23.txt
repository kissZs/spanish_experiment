I know that I haven't reached the planned 1000 hours yet, but I decided that it's time to bring the experiment to an end. Starting tomorrow I will start a 
'testing phase' in which I will give comprehension scores on a variety of different content. It will differ from the comprehension scores I gave thus far
in that the content will be randomly selected instead of being representative of what I do in my immersion, which will probably result in a fairer picture of 
what I can and can't do.

Given that I will write down everything I do during this period, I will stop writing the journal and I will not count the time sorted into the usual categories.
I estimate that it should take around 10-20 hours to complete the description, meaning that my total time spent on Spanish will be around 910-920 hours including 
my first attempt and my test phase.
