I started watching more Minecraft videos today and to my surprise, gameplays are not neccesarilly easier to understand than scripted videos about more complex things.
This is great because the Youtube algorithm is very good at making you waste your time, which actually works in my favor now, making immersion a lot easier.
This also means that I'm exposed to nontranslated Spanish for practically the first time, and it's not really aproblem to be honest, it doesn't feel any harder,
aside from the fact that I'm exposed to more accents, for example 'Miguel Gamer' has an interesting one where the main change is that he pronounces his y-s and ll-s
as an sh sound. I still find it a lot easier than European Spanish though. People also swear in English a lot, like 'what the fuck.' Although this might just be
because they are nerds.

I should mention that when giving my comprehension ratings, I'm not really thinking about it the whole week, I don't even remember my scale, instead, on Sundays or 
Saturdays, I ponder for about 30 minutes on each rating while immersing in that content. If the piece content I'm rating is shorter than 30 minutes (today should be first day that happens), 
that means I'll think about the rating for the whole duration of said content.
