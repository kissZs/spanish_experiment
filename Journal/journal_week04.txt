I take back what I said about ustedes, there appears to be a proper 2pl pronoun which is vosotros. But I'm I think that the conjugation of verbs might still be the same
for 2pl and 3pl, for son and estan at least. My current best guess for ustedes is that it's just a plural of usted, which is the polite version of the 2sg pronoun like
Ön is in Hungarian. (There is a similar distinction in German but I don't remember the word.) Except that if this is the case than it must be used in much less formal 
situations than it would be in Hungarian. Anyways, I listened to some Spanish Spanish for practically the first time and it definitely impacts my comprehension.
I can't really pin-point any difference other than the fact that it's just harder to understand and that it has a th sound in place of an s sound when it's written with a c

I came to a point where I almost never notice myself learning new words like I did in the beginning. This actually comforts me somewhat because this is what my experience with
immersion in other languages has been like, in fact, I was very surprised in the beginning by how conscious I was of the process, but now I can just sit back and let my
subconscious do the work. I will still make conscious guesses about the grammar purely because it's fun, I don't actually expect it to take me anywhere. I don't even find
myself guessing the meanings of words that I recognise all the time but don't know yet, the two that annoy me the most currently are 'ya' and 'se'. Furthermore I think I might
be starting to develop an intuitive sense of the difference between 'estás' and 'ser' which are the two main ways of expressing 'to be' for example 'estoy bien' sounds
much better than 'soy bien' and when giving your name 'soy' sounds better, but this is not at the point where either of them would sound wrong to me, yet.

It appears that a lot of scenes were censored in Dragon Ball. The problem is that they just staight up leave those parts in Japanase on every site I tried. 
Dragon ball Z seems to have a lot less censored scenes and they are also subtitled in Spanish, so what I do is I rip my headphones off my head when one these scenes
start, read the subtitles and put my headphones back on after the subs stop coming. I still count this as Audiovisual though because switching categories is a pain,
and it happens rarely enough that it should be negligible. On a completely unrelated I figured out a few days ago that the word for 'tomorrow' and 'morning' is the same.
I thought that this would be terribly confusing, but to my surprise it's really not, at least I didn't have any problems with it these past few days.

Rating content on my scale every week actually helps a lot with my motivation. Without it I don't think I'd notice any improvement, they force me to think more concretely
about how well I'm actually doing instead of just thinking 'yeah I understand some but not all', it makes me appreciate progress that I otherwise wouldn't even notice.
More great news: throughout the week I've been trying watching a bit of several different shows from my childhood and I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to choose 'easy content'
without much trouble, which has been a major source of stress so far. Yeah sure Nagatoro and H2O were great but I would dread the time they would be over because I had 
no guarantee that I'd find more things that are as 'easy'. This is not a problem anymore and I'm very happy, because honestly, this was the worst part of the experiment.
